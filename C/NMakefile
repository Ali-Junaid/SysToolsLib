#   File name	    NMakefile						      #
#									      #
#   Description     An NMake file for making all SysToolLib libs & programs   #
#									      #
#   Notes	    make.bat looks for a default nmake file called NMakeFile. #
#									      #
#   History								      #
#    2016-10-05 JFL jf.larvoire@hpe.com created this file.                    #
#    2016-10-11 JFL Adapted for use with make files in the global include dir.#
#    2016-10-13 JFL Added targets cleanenv and release.                       #
#    2016-10-14 JFL Fixed bugs in the inline release script.                  #
#    2016-11-02 JFL Use macro BATMAKE for recursive calls to make.bat.        #
#    2016-11-03 JFL Added target config.                                      #
#		    Updated the cleanenv: script to display the reg command   #
#		    it uses to delete the global environment variable.	      #
#    2017-03-16 JFL Resurrected this file, necessary to make release.         #
#    2017-08-29 JFL Added a help target overrifing the one in All.mak.        #
#    2017-10-05 JFL Store WIN64 programs too in the release file.             #
